# past-projects

Aleksandar Stevcic - IMD Student @ Carleton University 2015-2019


All past school and personal projects will be organized here and updated regularly as ample documentation + timeline of my progress in programming.


All work under IMD will be schooling projects, and owner's rights of those projects are dependent under Carleton University's policy.
